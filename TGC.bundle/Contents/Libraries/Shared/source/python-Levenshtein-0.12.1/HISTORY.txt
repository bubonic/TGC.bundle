============

* Fixed handling of numerous possible wraparounds in calculating the size
  of memory allocations; incorrect handling of which could cause denial
  of service or even possible remote code execution in previous versions
  of the library.

------

* Fixed a bug in StringMatcher.StringMatcher.get_matching_blocks /

  both Python 2 and Python 3, for simpler and working code.

  and made it reside inside a package, along with the StringMatcher
  class.

  were missing from source distributions.
